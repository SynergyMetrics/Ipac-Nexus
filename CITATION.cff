abstract: |
  This repository contains a non-commercial, open-source prototype of an open framework for aggregating human distress indicators, producing the Composite Distress Score (CDS)â€”a single composite score unifying existing indicators (e.g., hunger, inequality, conflict, governance) for crisis tracking and early warning. The CDS uses established composite index methods in a transparent, flexible, and action-oriented way, without introducing new mathematical operations. This prototype is offered to researchers, humanitarian organizations, and developers as a basis for further exploration.
